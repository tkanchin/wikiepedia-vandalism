Description
-----------

Wikipedia has over 35,000,000 articles in over 290 languages [1]. This content 
is created by over 73,000 active editors from around the globe. However, not all
the editors are good. Thousands of vandals make unconstructive edits to articles.
In our work, we propose an early warning system to detect vandals before they can
harm the community.

This dataset looks at a time period of 19 months from Jan 2013 to July 2014. During
this time period, almost 1 million users registered on English Wikipedia. Out of these
17,015 were vandals (users who were blocked by Wikipedia community for vandalism).
To match the vandals, we randomly collect edits made by an almost equal number of benign 
users. This dataset contains the edits made by all these editors.

Data Files and Format
---------------------
Note: All files are UTF-8 encoded.
      All csv files are stored as unicodecsv files [2].

users.csv:
	This file contains the list of all registered users contained in the dataset.
	The format is:
	username, userid, blocked_time, blocked_reason, type

	where
	username is the registered name of the user,	
	userid is the unique identifier for the user
	blocked_time is the time when the user was blocked by the administrators,
	blocked_reason is the reason given by administrators for blocking the user,
	and type indicates whether the user is "benign" or "vandal"

pages.csv:
	This file contains information about the pages that are edited by users
	in the dataset. The format of the file is:
	pagetitle,pageid,pagecategories
	
	where
	pagetitle is the title of the page
	pageid is the unique identifier of the page
	pagecategories is the Wikipedia Categories assigned to the page

benign_<year>_<month>.csv
	These files contain the edits made by benign users registered in the particular 
	year and month. The edits by each user are present in consecutive lines, separated
	from the next user by an empty line. For each user, the edits are sorted 
	chronologically, earliest edit first.
	
	The format of the file is
	username,revid,revtime,pagetitle,isReverted,revertTime,cluebotRevert,stiki_score,stiki_REP_USER
	
	where
	username is the unique identifier of the user
	revid is the id of the revision
	revtime is the time the revision is made
	pagetitle is the title of the page edited
	isReverted indicates whether the revision is reverted by other user/bot in future
	revertTime is the time the revision is reverted
	cluebotRevert indicates whether ClueBot NG reverts the edit
	stiki_score is the score given by STiki to the revision
	stiki_REP_USER is the User Reputation score given by STiki to the user after the revision is made

vandal_<year>_<month>.csv:
	These files contain the edits made by users blocked by Wikipedia administrators in <year> and <momth>.
	The format is the same as described for benign_<year>_<month>.csv files.
